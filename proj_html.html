<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This project aims at detailed analysis of the policing data set
37-00049_UOF-P_2016_prepped from Dallas, Texas in 2016.This will focus
on the most occurred Incidence frequency ,location,races involved in
crime ,use of force on the criminals and identify if there is racial
discrimination on the force application on the criminal.</p>

<p>It can be observed from the graph above ,the most Incidence at night
occurred after 8PM comparatively high to the number of cases in early
mornings with medium rise in cases from 12 PM to 2 PM.</p>
<p>Also, there was a peak of Incidence observed in the month of March
and September while there was a sharp decline in the Incidence from
October to December.</p>

<p>The interactive map above allows you to navigate the spatial crime
data at street level. Each cluster reflects incidences that occurred
within the polygon within that cluster. It is clear from this
visualization that the proportion of crime is higher in the
CENTRAL,NORTH CENTRAL,SOUTHWEST and SOUTHEAST division . Meaning, this
can be a popular diverse crime hot spot and St. Lamar st,St. Forest St
and Commerce St. are also the most Incident reported streets.</p>

<p>It can be observed that the top 3 reasons for force applied on the
subjects are Arrest,Active Aggression and Danger to self or others.</p>
<p>The bar plot displays the injury of the subject accross different
races and gender.It appears that most of the black population both male
and female had injuries like “Abrasion/Scrape” and “Laceration/Cut”
followed by the White population.</p>

<p>The first bar chart describes the force applied by the officer
belonging to different races on subjects of different race.It can be
interpreted that there seems to be no evident discrimination for the
races in terms of the force application by any race of officers.</p>
<p>The second bar chart represents the officer experience and the number
of cases handles and it seems that most of the cases are handled by
officers of experience 0 to 3.There are few officers with experience
more than 25 years.</p>
